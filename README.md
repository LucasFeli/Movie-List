<div aling="center">

I Made a to-do list with vanilla JS, bootswatch and fontawesome. You can make your list with your favorites movies<br> of all time, also if you want to delete one of them, you can do it, just click the red X button.

Thanks!

Note: soon this and anothers apps, web pages, etc will be show in my web profesional portfolio.
